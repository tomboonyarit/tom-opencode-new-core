description: Grilling session that challenges your plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallise. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan against their project's language and documented decisions.

## Instructions
- Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. 
- Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.
- Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing.
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

## Domain awareness
During codebase exploration, also look for existing documentation:

### File structure
Most repos have a single context:
```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:
```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session
### Challenge against the glossary
When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately.

### Sharpen fuzzy language
When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term.

### Discuss concrete scenarios
When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios.

### Cross-reference with code
When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees.

### Update CONTEXT.md inline
When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there.

### Offer ADRs sparingly
Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true: Hard to reverse, Surprising without context, The result of a real trade-off.
